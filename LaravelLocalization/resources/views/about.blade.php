    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Laravel provides two ways to manage translation strings. First, language strings may be stored in files within the application's lang directory. Within this directory, there may be subdirectories for each language supported by the application. This is the approach Laravel uses to manage translation strings for built-in Laravel features such as validation error messages</p>
